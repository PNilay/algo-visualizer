# AlgoVisulalizer

## Description:

The web application “Algo-Visualizer” is designed to visualize various types of path finding algorithms in graph data structure. Use link https://pnilay.github.io/algo-visualizer/ to access “Algo-Visualizer” pathfinding application.

A graph is a set of nodes where some pairs of nodes are connected using directed or undirected links/edges. A graph may be weighted (numerical value associated with connection between two nodes) or unweighted (all connection have unit weight or all connections have the same constant weight)

Pathfinding is a way to identify the path from a source to a destination avoiding obstacles and minimizing the costs. Pathfinding is a practical variant on solving mazes, which explores routes between nodes, starting at source and traversing through graph networks until the goal node has been reached. Pathfinding algorithms apply to a huge range of applications, such as google maps, routing packets over the internet, satellite navigation system, games, road building, and many more.

Below are a few popular pathfinding algorithms.
